Excessively short `b, p, d, t, g, k` are annotated as `.b, .p, .d, .t, .g, .k`

Extra annotations for Chinese "yár" (~iar) and "wánr" (~uar/uanr) sounds, you can use them with `iar`, `uanr`

End breaths are annotated, you can use `EP` at the end of sentences

Initial `m`, `n` in sentences are annotated, you can use `_m`, `_n` to apply them

You can modify the `character.yaml` and `character.txt` to change the character images and avatars. The `image` folder contains a set of replacement images for character illustrations and avatars
